The Converter Control libraries are open source C libraries, released under the GNU Lesser General Public License.

The project contains five libraries and three test programs:

* libfg - function generation - finished
* libreg - current or field regulation - finished
* libcal - DAC, ADC and DCCT calibration - finished
* libcc - real-time converter control, uses libfg and libreg - about to be started
* libtest - ANSI terminal suppoert - finished

* cctest - non-real-time test program for libfg and libreg - in development
* ccrt - real-time test program from libcc, libfg and libreg - about to be started
* termtest - simple test program for libterm - finished

Some more features will be added to cctest in preparation for forking it to create the multi-threaded real-time test program that will be called ccrt and which will test the new library libcc. This will be will be written during the first half of 2015.
