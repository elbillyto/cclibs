Libreg is basically finished. V6 is a major upgrade that adds the concept of the cycle selector to cctest. 
This will allow thorough testing of the LOAD SELECT and LOAD TEST SELECT parameters in libreg.

Work will soon focus on libcc and the associated test program ccrt. Both should be ready by mid-2015.
