Libreg is nearly finished. V5 is a major upgrade that adds a new interface for libreg parameters which massively simplifies the use of libreg. 

A number of smaller features are on their way, but they will not significantly change the API.

Work will soon focus on libcc and the associated test program ccrt. Both should be ready by early 2015.
