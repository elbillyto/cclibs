The Converter Control libraries are open source C libraries, released under the GNU Lesser General Public License.

The project contains six libraries and three test programs:

* libref - reference manager, uses libfg and libreg - in development
* libfg - function generation - finished
* libreg - current or field regulation - finished for now
* libcal - DAC, ADC and DCCT calibration - finished
* libtest - ANSI terminal suppoert - finished

* ccrt - multi-threaded test program for libref, libfg and libreg - in development
* cctest - single-threaded test program for libfg and libreg - finished
* termtest - simple test program for libterm - finished

New in v8:

* typdef REG_float introduced in libreg to allow float or double to be easily chosen
* typdef FG_float introduced in libfg to allow float or double to be easily chosen
* Power converter output tone simulation added to existing noise simulation:
** PC SIM_RIPPLE -> PC SIM_NOISE_PP
** PC SIM_TONE_PERIOD_ITERS added
** PC SIM_TONE_PP added
* Power converter simulation parameters renamed to have SIM_ prefix:
** PC BANDWIDTH -> PC SIM_BANDWIDTH
** PC Z -> PC SIM_Z
** PC TAU_ZERO -> PC SIM_TAU_ZERO
* Measurement simulated tone half period parameter replaced:
** MEAS TONE_HALF_PERIOD_ITERS -> MEAS SIM_TONE_PERIOD_ITERS
* Measurement simulation tone amplitude parameters replaced:
** MEAS B_SIM_TONE_AMP -> MEAS B_SIM_TONE_PP
** MEAS I_SIM_TONE_AMP -> MEAS I_SIM_TONE_PP
* Libreg API for regInit() changed to add bool v_regulation in anticipation of voltage regulation support
